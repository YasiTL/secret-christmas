      Santa has no clue how to do taxes on all the toys he buys, err... makes..., without the receipts.
      But he noticed that the elves have randomly ripped off barcodes from various recepts and glued them onto
      papers around the workshop. Elves are not known for their bookkeeping skills.
      Santa picked up one paper and needs to find out how much he spent on toys.
